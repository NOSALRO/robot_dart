## Scripts for Quick Installation of RobotDART

In this page we provide standalone scripts for installing RobotDART for `Ubuntu` (>=20.04), `OSX` and beta support for Windows (via WSL). The scripts will install all the required dependencies and RobotDART. Notably, all dependencies that need to be compiled by source and RobotDART will be installed inside the `/opt` folder. This way, one can be rest assured that their system will be clean.

#### Video recording to file

[ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) is needed for enabling the video recording capabilities. You can install this at any time using your favorite package manager (e.g. `apt` for Ubuntu or `brew` for Mac OSX).

### Ubuntu >=20.04

To quickly install RobotDART on `Ubuntu >=20.04`, we just need to run `./scripts/install_ubuntu.sh` from the root of the repo. In more detail:

- `git clone https://github.com/resibots/robot_dart.git`
- `cd robot_dart`
- `./scripts/install_ubuntu.sh`

This will install everything needed! Once the script is successfully executed, one should add the following to their `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file (you may need to swap the python version to yours[^1]):

```bash
export PATH=/opt/magnum/bin:$PATH
export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/robot_dart:/opt/magnum
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/magnum/lib:/opt/robot_dart/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export PYTHONPATH=/opt/robot_dart/lib/python3.10/site-packages:/opt/magnum/lib/python3/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH
```

<!-- ```bash
export PATH=/opt/magnum/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/dart/lib:/opt/magnum/lib:/opt/robot_dart/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export PYTHONPATH=/opt/dart/lib/python3/dist-packages:/opt/robot_dart/lib/python3.8/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH
``` -->

### Beta Windows support via WSL

The installation script for Ubuntu works also in WSL (with the Ubuntu base image). There might be some issues with the graphical interface (see [here](https://github.com/NOSALRO/robot_dart/issues/214)).

### OSX

To quickly install RobotDART on `Mac OSX`, we just need to run `./scripts/install_osx.sh` from the root of the repo. In more detail:

- `git clone https://github.com/resibots/robot_dart.git`
- `cd robot_dart`
- `./scripts/install_osx.sh`

This will install everything needed! Once the script is successfully executed, one should add the following to their `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file (you may need to swap the python version to yours[^1]):

```bash
export PATH=/opt/magnum/bin:$PATH
export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/robot_dart:/opt/dart:/opt/magnum
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/magnum/lib:/opt/dart/lib:/opt/robot_dart/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/magnum/lib:/opt/dart/lib:/opt/robot_dart/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
export PYTHONPATH=/opt/dart:/opt/dart/lib/python3/dist-packages:/opt/robot_dart/lib/python3.12/site-packages:/opt/magnum/lib/python3/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH
```

[^1]: You can run `python --version` to see your version. We only keep the major.minor (ignoring the patch version)
