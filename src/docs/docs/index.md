# RobotDART

RobotDART is a **C++ robot simulator** (with optional Python bindings) built on top of the [DART] physics engine. The RobotDART simulator is **intended to be used by *Robotics and Machine Learning researchers*** who want to write controllers or test learning algorithms **without the delays and overhead** that usually comes with other simulators (e.g., [Gazebo], [Coppelia-sim]).

For this reason, **the simulator runs headless by default**, and there is the possibility of *rendering the scene (e.g., through a camera sensor) without opening a graphics window*. All RobotDART's code is **thread-safe** (including *graphics and camera sensors*), and thus enables its users to **use their code in parallel jobs in multicore computers**.

In a few words, RobotDART combines:

- a physics engine (DART)
- an optional graphics engine (Magnum)
- a few sensor classes (IMU, force/torque sensors, cameras, etc.)
- a curated URDF library
- ... and a few useful features to make the life of roboticists/researchers easier

## Main Features

* Modern C++ code that makes it easy to develop environments and applications
* **Fast and reliable simulation** of robotic mechanisms and their interactions (through the [DART] physics engine)
* A structured `Robot` class that enables a unified creation and access to all important values: in RobotDART you can load any robot description file (URDF, SDF, SKEL, and MuJoCo files) with the same command, and all robot measurements can be queried without using any DART code
* A generic `RobotControl` class that enables fast prototyping of any type of controller
* A generic `Sensor` class that allows the creation of any kind of sensor
* A growing list of already implemented **sensors**, that includes 6-axis `ForceTorque`, `IMU`, `RGB`, and `RGB-D` sensors
* A simulation class (`RobotDARTSimu`) that handles multiple robots and sensors, and allows for step-by-step simulation
* A growing list of supported robots along with edited and optimized models to be used with RobotDART (see the [robots page](robots.md) for details and examples):
    * PAL Talos humanoid
    * Franka Emika Panda
    * KUKA LBR Iiwa (14kg version)
    * IIT iCub humanoid (without hands)
    * Unitree A1 quadruped robot
    * Dynamixel-based 6-legged robot
    * A simple arm for educational purposes
    * and you can use any URDF
* A **custom graphical interface** built on top of [Magnum] that allows generic customization
* Support for **windowless OpenGL context creation** (even in parallel threads!) to allow for camera sensor usage even in parallel jobs running on clusters
* Support for **video recording in simulation time** (i.e., not affected by delays of simulator and/or graphics) for visualization or debugging purposes
* Full-featured **Python bindings** for fast prototyping
* RobotDART runs on any Linux distribution and Mac OS

## What RobotDART is not

- RobotDART is primarily intended to be non-interactive (run a simulation, record/view the result),
- Interaction is limited to changing the view and your own code. No GUI for adding objects or interactively build an environment,
- RobotDART is not optimized for wheeled robots,
- RobotDART is not optimized for simulating complex (e.g., mountain-like) terrains.
